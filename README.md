# e-periodica OAI-PMH - Ethnology and Folklore
This script was done to download the metadata of [e-periodica](https://www.e-periodica.ch/) through their OAI-PMH endpoint (`https://www.e-periodica.ch/oai`) that could be interesting to the PIA research project as we want to link our image-based collections to the e-periodica articles. 

There are more than 16k metadata articles which have the 390 `setSpec` (Ethnology, folklore) on e-periodica. Probably, the more relevant articles come from the `Korrespondenzbl√§ttern der SGV` (more than 2k articles), divided into these three sources: 

- https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/volumes?UID=sgv-001 
- https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/volumes?UID=sgv-002
- https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/volumes?UID=sgv-003
